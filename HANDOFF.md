## Current implementation

The modernization branch still contains the unchanged legacy React/Vite frontend, Supabase content and authentication integration, Formspree contact submission, GA4, PHP visitor logging, and the source-described Hostinger/static deployment model.

No framework, runtime, data, provider, or visual migration has started. The existing production visual identity remains authoritative and is now represented by `docs/VISUAL_BASELINE.md` and tracked Playwright snapshots.

## Continuation order

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for permanent governance.
2. Read `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` for verified current truth.
3. Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` before proposing architecture work.
4. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, and `docs/OPERATIONS.md` for current boundaries.
5. Read the latest appended entry in `PROCESS.md` for chronological context.
6. Read `docs/VISUAL_BASELINE.md` before any frontend, framework, or delivery implementation.

## Phase 2A outcome and Phase 2B boundary

Phase 2A produced a reviewed, source-controlled specification and nothing else. It created no provider resource and changed no runtime, dependency, package, or workflow file.

The specification is spread across four documents, each with a distinct job:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — target staging topology, request flows, data ownership, and write ordering.
- `docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md` — environment and resource map, naming, bindings, non-secret variables, secret names, and isolation rules.
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — trust boundaries, private-surface authorization, and fail-closed requirements.
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` — artifact identity, staging deployment, smoke matrix, promotion, and rollback.

Confirmed direction: the first Cloudflare migration is a hosting migration only. React/Vite is preserved, delivery is Worker plus Static Assets, staging and production share no mutable resource, `APP_DB` and `ANALYTICS_DB` are separate authorities, `/boss/*` is protected by Cloudflare Access and independently verified in the Worker, public forms are Turnstile-protected, submissions persist before any notification, and Resend is delivery only.

Three legacy surfaces do not migrate and receive no compatibility routes: the `/run/` PHP visitor log, replaced by first-party PAGE analytics in `ANALYTICS_DB`; the third-party form endpoint, replaced by a Worker submission endpoint writing to `APP_DB`; and `/control-room`, replaced by `/boss/*` with its canonical Dashboard, Analytics, Content, Submissions, Audit, and System areas. Cloudflare staging holds content in its own isolated `APP_DB`, bootstrapped once from a read-only snapshot of authoritative production content, and never reads or writes the production Supabase project. These are decisions D-017 to D-020.

The analytics target adopts the proven Analytics V3 reference from the start
rather than rediscovering it. Raw `visitor_events` detail is never purged
automatically; scheduled work aggregates only. The 90-day maximum is a policy
commitment that Boss System must surface as oldest-raw-event age plus an overdue
state, met by an audited manual deletion with preview and explicit confirmation.
Daily aggregates are readable only for local days an explicit coverage ledger
marks as covered; coverage is never inferred from `MIN`/`MAX`; uncovered, current
and partial days fall back to indexed raw events; Top-N truncation happens only
after raw and aggregate sources are merged. The event stream, INSPECT and export
stay raw, and INSPECT reuses the loaded row without an extra D1 request. Known
cost risks — OFFSET pagination and exact `COUNT(DISTINCT ip_address)` — are
recorded in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. See decisions D-021 and D-022.

Phase 2B is partially provisioned. The two staging D1 databases exist and are
verified empty: `hakan-run-app-staging` (`71a28b10-861f-4554-9e14-5464c7116394`)
and `hakan-run-analytics-staging` (`4998c398-4f42-4472-a008-24e737359a03`). The
Worker service, Access application, Turnstile widget and staging hostname remain
outstanding and need owner action in the Cloudflare dashboard, because the
connected tooling can create D1 databases but not Workers, bindings, Access
applications, Turnstile widgets or DNS records. The staging content schema and
bootstrap belong to Phase 2C.

An editable social/OG card is now on the roadmap as Phase 9B: the served card is
generated from published `APP_DB` content, Boss edits a bounded set of text
fields, and the visual identity stays system-controlled. See decision D-023.

Provider access, resource creation, secrets, databases, deployment, activation, DNS, push, and production changes remain separately authorized. Any later frontend delivery must use the Phase 1B baseline as its parity contract.
