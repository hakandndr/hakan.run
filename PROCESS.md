# Development and Handoff Process

This process separates source editing, validation, build, commit, push, migration, deployment, service access, and secret management into independent scopes.

## 1. Establish the baseline

```bash
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git status --short
git remote -v
node --version
npm --version
```

Record uncommitted files before editing. Do not stage or clean unrelated work. Local configuration, environment files, secrets, logs, `dist/`, and test output remain outside normal source commits.

## 2. Locate the real implementation

1. Read the route and component that render the behavior.
2. Trace content through `content.js`, `ContentContext.jsx`, and the consuming component.
3. Check whether a Control Room field is actually consumed by the public UI.
4. For Supabase work, compare browser behavior, migration policy, and the separately verified live policy.
5. For PHP work, include the endpoint, `run/.htaccess`, the Control Room caller, and the separate deployment boundary.
6. Select relevant tests and generated artifacts.

Do not use README statements as a substitute for reading source.

## 3. Implementation rules

- Preserve the current visual system unless a visual change is explicitly authorized.
- Keep repository code, comments, configuration, tests, and documentation in English.
- Keep the repository vendor-neutral except where a named runtime dependency or service is technically required.
- Do not add secondary authorship or automated attribution metadata.
- Keep service-role credentials out of the browser and out of `VITE_*` variables.
- Represent database policy changes as migrations rather than dashboard-only instructions.
- Review cross-route hash scrolling when changing header or footer navigation.
- Treat unknown project-slug behavior as an explicit routing decision.

## 4. Local validation

Use the repository-recommended Node version when possible:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run lint
npm test
```

`npm test` builds and previews the production artifact, then runs Playwright in desktop Chrome and Pixel 5 profiles. It does not validate live Supabase, PHP, Formspree submission, hosting, or deployment.

For an explicitly authorized standalone Windows build, run the generator and Vite directly if the app package script's shell chain is unreliable:

```powershell
Set-Location apps/web
node tools/generate-llms.js
npx vite build --outDir ../../dist/apps/web
```

Verify the artifact timestamp, `index.html`, `.htaccess`, public metadata files, and current hashed asset references. A parser or exit code alone is not sufficient evidence of a valid artifact.

## 5. Browser smoke test

When browser validation is in scope, check:

- the one-time terminal loader and subsequent navigation;
- desktop and mobile header navigation;
- Services, Portfolio, About, Stats, and CTA visibility;
- internal and external portfolio card behavior;
- `/contact` structure and client-side validation;
- known project routes and an unknown project slug;
- the designed 404 route;
- reduced-motion and keyboard focus behavior;
- browser console and failed network requests.

Control Room, Supabase saves, MFA, tracker reads, and real form submissions require separate integration authorization and safe test data.

## 6. Git preparation

Before staging:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Stage explicit paths rather than using broad staging commands. Then inspect the index:

```bash
git diff --cached --check
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

Verify the repository-local identity:

```bash
git config --local user.name
git config --local user.email
```

Commits must use `Hakan Dundar <hakan@dndr.net>` as both author and committer and must not contain additional attribution trailers.

## 7. Release boundary

A commit is not a push. A push is not a deployment. A frontend deployment is not a PHP deployment. A source migration is not a live migration.

A typical authorized release may include:

```text
source change -> validation -> build -> commit -> push -> CI -> upload -> cache purge -> live smoke test
```

Each arrow requires its own applicable authorization and result reporting. The repository currently has no automated production deployment workflow.

## 8. Handoff record

Record:

- baseline branch and SHA;
- files changed and why;
- validation commands and results;
- build artifact status;
- commit SHA and identity;
- push status;
- CI status;
- migration status;
- deployment status;
- live verification status;
- unresolved risks and the next bounded action.

Update the documentation when routes, content authority, security boundaries, PHP protocols, build commands, test coverage, or deployment behavior change.

## 2026-09-01 — Phase 1A: Modernization governance foundation

### Objective

Create an isolated modernization working copy and establish permanent, vendor-neutral governance and documentation continuity without changing the legacy implementation.

### Starting Git state

- Legacy working copy: `D:\IT\hakan\hakan-run`
- Legacy branch: `main`
- Legacy HEAD and `origin/main`: `e3467d221470f5776bf435a5c770a17d0c45f7fb`
- Legacy ahead/behind: `0 / 0`
- Legacy working tree: clean
- Modernization target: absent before cloning

### Approved scope

Read-only legacy verification; fresh clone; repository-local owner identity; one local modernization branch; governance and documentation foundation; documentation validation; and one local governance commit. Push, deployment, migration, provider changes, dependencies, runtime modernization, and redesign were outside scope.

### Files changed

- Added `AGENTS.md`.
- Reconciled `HANDOFF.md` for zero-context modernization continuation.
- Appended this entry to `PROCESS.md` without rewriting prior content.
- Added `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/LESSONS.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, and `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.
- Reconciled `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to separate current and planned architecture.
- Added minimal governance and modernization pointers to `README.md`.

### Architecture implications

No implementation changed. Documentation now records the current legacy architecture first and a separately labeled Cloudflare target concept that is not implemented. Hosting migration is explicitly decoupled from any optional framework migration.

### Data implications

No database or mutable resource changed. The planned model distinguishes application persistence, bounded analytics, and external notification, but creates none of them.

### Security implications

No security control changed. Current broad authenticated Supabase write access and PHP reader authorization debt remain documented. Target fail-closed principles are plans, not claims of implementation.

### Commands and results

```text
git branch --show-current; git rev-parse HEAD; git rev-parse origin/main
-> PASS — legacy main, HEAD, and origin/main matched the expected baseline.

git status --short --untracked-files=all
-> PASS — legacy working tree was clean.

target directory inspection including hidden entries
-> PASS — modernization target did not exist; no directory removal was needed.

git clone https://github.com/hakandndr/hakan.run.git D:\IT\hakan\hakan-run-next
-> PASS — fresh clone completed at the expected baseline.

git config --local user.name / user.email
-> PASS — repository-local identity is Hakan Dundar <hakan@dndr.net>.

git switch -c develop/hakan-run-v2 e3467d221470f5776bf435a5c770a17d0c45f7fb
-> PASS — local modernization branch created from the verified baseline.

git diff --check and documentation hygiene/link validation
-> PASS — completed before the governance commit.
```

No dependency installation, application build, runtime test suite, provider check, or live-state test was authorized or performed in this phase.

### Failures, failed approaches, and corrections

The initial combined documentation patch was rejected because it attempted to delete and add the same path in one patch operation. No file changed in that failed operation. The change was split into discrete file patches and then applied successfully.

The first structural count gate incorrectly expected 13 roadmap phases. The required sequence contains 14 entries because Phase 1 has separate 1A and 1B entries in addition to Phases 0 and 2–12. The gate was corrected to 14 and reran successfully. No implementation failure occurred.

### Deliberate non-actions

No push, deployment, migration, activation, provider access, secret handling, dependency change, framework migration, frontend redesign, backend work, production change, or legacy repository modification was performed.

### Commit and external state

- Commit: the single local commit containing this entry, with subject `chore: establish modernization governance`; resolve its immutable SHA with `git log -1 --format=%H -- PROCESS.md`.
- Push: not performed.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Migration: not performed.
- Infrastructure: not created or changed.

### Unresolved issues

- The visual/frontend baseline has not yet been captured as reproducible parity evidence.
- Known legacy authorization and data-authority debt remains unchanged.
- Modernization staging architecture has not been implemented or provisioned.

### Exact next recommended action

Perform Phase 1B — visual/frontend baseline freeze in the modernization working copy, with separately approved scope and no redesign or deployment.

---

## 2026-09-01 — Phase 1B: Visual/frontend baseline freeze

### Objective

Freeze the inherited public visual, responsive, route, interaction, and motion behavior as source-derived documentation and deterministic regression evidence before infrastructure or framework migration.

### Starting state

- Working copy: `D:\IT\hakan\hakan-run-next`
- Branch: `develop/hakan-run-v2`
- HEAD: `392d333b2da2ffc1754d6f0e3ba79c542ff0144a`
- `origin/main` and merge base: `e3467d221470f5776bf435a5c770a17d0c45f7fb`
- Ahead/behind relative to `origin/main`: `1 / 0`
- Working tree: clean
- Repository-local identity: `Hakan Dundar <hakan@dndr.net>`
- Runtime: Node `v22.23.2`, npm `10.9.8`; repository recommendation `.nvmrc` `20.19.1`
- Modernization branch: local only; no push or deployment had occurred

### Approved scope

Source inspection, existing installed dependency use, local build and tests, local browser inspection, deterministic public screenshots, test-only visual regression coverage, documentation, and one local commit. Dependency installation or upgrade, source/runtime changes, public content changes, private Control Room authentication, provider changes, push, deployment, migration, activation, DNS, secrets, and infrastructure were outside scope.

### Files changed

- Added `docs/VISUAL_BASELINE.md` as the canonical source-derived visual contract.
- Added `tests/visual/visual-baseline.spec.ts` and 21 Windows Chromium reference snapshots.
- Updated `HANDOFF.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, and `docs/LESSONS.md` for Phase 1B continuity.
- Appended this entry to `PROCESS.md`.
- Application source, runtime/backend files, public content, packages, lockfiles, provider configuration, and infrastructure were not changed.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and `AGENTS.md` were reviewed and remained factually current, so no artificial edits were made.

### Commands and results

```text
git branch --show-current; git rev-parse HEAD; git rev-parse origin/main; git status --short --untracked-files=all
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD; git config --local --get user.name/user.email; git log -5
node --version; npm --version; Get-Content .nvmrc
-> PASS — the exact required baseline, clean state, local owner identity, runtime versions, and commit chain were verified before modification.

source inspection with rg, Get-Content, Git metadata, and local image inspection
-> PASS — public routes, private boundary, component/content authority, assets, typography, colors, spacing, breakpoints, motion, and brand-mark occurrences were inventoried from source.

.\\node_modules\\.bin\\vite.cmd build --outDir ../../dist/apps/web
-> PASS — Vite 4.5.14 transformed 1,730 modules into dist/apps/web in 3.84 s.
-> Output — index.html 3.06 kB / 1.08 kB gzip; CSS 42.19 kB / 8.32 kB gzip; JS 643.14 kB / 190.07 kB gzip.
-> Warning — the JavaScript chunk exceeds Vite's 500 kB advisory threshold.

npm run lint
-> PASS — application ESLint completed with exit code 0.

.\\node_modules\\.bin\\playwright.cmd test --reporter=line --workers=1
-> PASS — existing suite: 19 passed, 1 conditional mobile skip, exit code 0.

.\\node_modules\\.bin\\playwright.cmd test tests/visual/visual-baseline.spec.ts --project=chromium --workers=1 --reporter=line --update-snapshots
-> PASS — 21 snapshots generated after the final required viewport and selector corrections.

.\\node_modules\\.bin\\playwright.cmd test tests/visual/visual-baseline.spec.ts --project=chromium --workers=1 --reporter=line
-> PASS — 3 focused tests and all 21 snapshot comparisons passed without updates in 33.0 s.

.\\node_modules\\.bin\\playwright.cmd test --reporter=line --workers=1
-> PASS — final integrated suite: 22 passed and 4 conditional/project skips across 26 cases in 49.7 s; snapshots were not updated.
```

The build and test processes rewrote `apps/web/public/llms.txt` only through line-ending normalization. A whitespace-insensitive diff proved there was no content difference; each tool-created working-tree change was restored to the original HEAD version before review.

### Visual and behavioral findings

- The public matrix contains `/`, `/contact`, three known project slugs, a source fallback that renders full-stack content for unknown project slugs, a real noindex catch-all 404, `/admin` redirecting home, and the private-intent `/control-room` SPA route.
- Desktop baseline is `1440 × 1200`; mobile is `390 × 844`. Additional `1024 × 900` and `768 × 900` evidence records distinct `lg` and `md` transitions.
- At exactly 768 px, desktop header navigation is active while the hero photo remains hidden until 1024 px. Grid transitions occur independently by component.
- Public pages showed no document-level horizontal overflow in the tested matrix. Mobile navigation opened and closed, and the Expertise row toggled between RUNNING and IDLE.
- The current Header SVG, favicon, and Footer render `<h>`; Header and Control Room also contain `<hakan.run />`; the OG image uses `</>`. None implements the approved future `<h/>` rule consistently.
- Expertise triggers are clickable `div` elements without native button semantics or expansion attributes. Mobile menu toggles lack explicit expanded/control attributes. These existing accessibility limitations were documented, not redesigned.

### Screenshot stabilization

The test fixes viewport dimensions, bypasses only the one-time session loader, clears local storage, blocks non-local HTTP requests, waits for fonts, requests reduced motion, completes viewport-triggered entrances, applies test-only near-zero animation/transition duration, hides the caret, and masks no design element. Production animation code and values remain unchanged.

### Failures, failed approaches, and corrections

- A first build attempt used `node apps/web/tools/generate-llms.js` while already inside `apps/web`, producing a doubled path and `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The path was corrected.
- With no dependency tree inside the fresh clone, an `npx` attempt waited for package resolution and was interrupted; no package was installed. A direct generator run first hit a sandbox `EPERM`, then an attempted `NODE_PATH` reuse failed because Vite's ESM plugin resolution does not use `NODE_PATH`.
- Two ignored machine-local directory junctions were created to reference the already installed legacy dependency trees without copying, installing, or changing package metadata. The successful build and tests used those existing packages. The junctions are not tracked or portable repository requirements.
- The first visual run used an unsupported file-level conditional-skip callback signature and stopped before snapshots. It was changed to a supported `beforeEach` condition.
- The next visual run revealed an invalid page-coordinate clip, two matching `[x]` controls in the open mobile menu, and a false assumption that Expertise rows were semantic buttons. The test was corrected to capture CTA and Footer separately, scope the overlay close control, and assert the real RUNNING/IDLE row behavior.
- The initial desktop capture used `1440 × 1000`; review against the authorization corrected it to the exact required `1440 × 1200` and regenerated affected snapshots before final validation.

### Deliberate non-actions

No production UI or public content was edited. No runtime/backend, dependency, package, lockfile, framework, database, provider, Supabase, Hostinger, Cloudflare, D1, Resend, Turnstile, DNS, secret, or production state was changed. Control Room was not authenticated or captured. No push or deployment occurred. The approved `<h/>` correction was inventoried only and not implemented.

### Commit and external state

- Commit: the single local commit containing this entry, with subject `test: establish visual regression baseline`; resolve its immutable SHA with `git log -1 --format=%H -- PROCESS.md`.
- Push: not performed.
- Deployment: not performed.
- Migration/activation: not performed.
- Infrastructure/provider state: not accessed or changed.

### Unresolved issues

- The current brand-mark implementations remain inconsistent with the approved future `<h/>` rule.
- Existing accessibility, unknown-project fallback, mixed content authority, authorization, and bundle-size debt remain unchanged.
- Snapshot filenames are platform-specific Windows Chromium evidence; cross-platform image baselines require an explicit strategy if CI later runs visual comparisons on another operating system.
- Cloudflare staging architecture and resources do not exist.

### Exact next recommended action

Perform Phase 2 — design and review the isolated Cloudflare staging architecture/foundation. Do not create, configure, deploy, activate, or connect provider resources without separate authorization.

## 2026-09-01 — Phase 1C: Modernization branch publication preparation

### Objective

Document, verify, and publish the reviewed modernization history to `origin/develop/hakan-run-v2` with upstream tracking, without changing `main`, triggering deployment, or mutating production or provider state.

### Starting state

- Working copy: `D:\IT\hakan\hakan-run-next`
- Branch: `develop/hakan-run-v2`
- HEAD: `cf5cd7ddd67950338ce9f7550039fdc9bf907bf8`
- `origin/main`: `e3467d221470f5776bf435a5c770a17d0c45f7fb`
- Ahead/behind relative to `origin/main`: `2 / 0`
- Working tree: clean
- Repository-local identity: `Hakan Dundar <hakan@dndr.net>`
- Existing upstream: none
- Remote `develop/hakan-run-v2`: absent

### Approved scope

Inspection, necessary documentation updates, one local documentation commit, one normal push of `develop/hakan-run-v2` with upstream tracking, and post-push verification. Runtime/source changes, dependency changes, main push, merge, rebase, force push, deployment, migration, provider access, secrets, databases, DNS, and infrastructure changes remain outside scope.

### Remote and workflow verification

`git ls-remote --heads origin refs/heads/main refs/heads/develop/hakan-run-v2` returned only `main` at `e3467d221470f5776bf435a5c770a17d0c45f7fb`. The target remote branch therefore did not exist before publication.

The only workflow is `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`. Its push filter includes only `main` and `master`; its pull-request filter also targets only those branches. It contains tests and artifact upload but no deployment, publication, production environment, or provider mutation step. A direct push to `develop/hakan-run-v2` is therefore expected to trigger no workflow and no deployment.

### Documentation changes

- `HANDOFF.md`: Phase 1C and pending publication state.
- `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`: local-only branch state until push completion.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: Phase 1C current and Phase 2A planned.
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md`: verified branch-publication and upstream-tracking procedure.
- `PROCESS.md`: this append-only preparation record.

No application, runtime, backend, package, lockfile, workflow, provider, infrastructure, or production file was changed.

### Publication checkpoint

- Documentation commit: the single local commit containing this preparation entry, with subject `docs: record modernization branch publication`.
- Planned push: `git push --set-upstream origin develop/hakan-run-v2`.
- Push result: pending until the documentation commit is verified.
- Workflow result: no run expected for a direct push to this branch; observation pending.
- Deployment: not authorized and not performed.
- Exact next step after successful publication: Phase 2A — Cloudflare staging architecture/specification.

### Publication completion reconciliation

- Documentation commit: `9f1d5ce444c62126fd217628717372006678e4c4`, `docs: record modernization branch publication`.
- Push command: `git push --set-upstream origin develop/hakan-run-v2`.
- Push result: success; the new remote branch was created and upstream tracking was established.
- Final local and remote branch SHA: `9f1d5ce444c62126fd217628717372006678e4c4`.
- Final branch ahead/behind relative to its upstream: `0 / 0`.
- Remote `main`: unaffected by this publication. It was at `e3467d221470f5776bf435a5c770a17d0c45f7fb` when the branch was published, and separate legacy maintenance has since advanced it to `648c609dcc7837af8a9910ae788e222504cdbeb2`. No `main` commit, merge, or push originated from this working copy, and nothing from `main` has been merged into this branch.
- Workflow observation: the public GitHub Actions API reported zero runs for `develop/hakan-run-v2`; no CI was triggered because the workflow push filter includes only `main` and `master`.
- Deployment and infrastructure: no deployment occurred and no provider or infrastructure state changed.
- Exact next phase: Phase 2A — Cloudflare staging architecture/specification.
